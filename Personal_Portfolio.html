                True cartoon lightbulb above the head ideas are rare. Such ideas making their way to reality is truly mythical. The discovery of Crosley's use of 92mm fan hole spacing for their speakers sparked such an idea. Half a decade of iterative changes lead to a computer case with all the modern conveniences and a few exotic features. Along with full front panel IO, this record player sports two knobs driven by rotary encoders. This allows the user to control volume, skip tracks, pause and play media, or do just about anything one might require of a knob based interface. A hacked up HP case houses the majority of the computer components along with a salvage Dell hard drive cage. Noctua fans produce all the necessary airflow including a 120mm Noctua fan mounted to an antique record. This journey developed skills in woodworking, fabrication, interface design, 3D modeling, 3D printing, salvaging, hardware selection, and Python.

                Every few hundred dumpster dives seem to turn up something special. This case is nothing if not special. Originally used to duplicate CDs, its front panel now consists of three 120mm fans. As the case was not designed to house a motherboard, standoffs were modeled, printed, and installed. USB 3.0 ports replaced the previously installed USB 2.0 ports. This project developed skill in salvaging, 3D modeling, 3D printing, fabrication, and woodworking.

                This project started with a MatLab induced fire in a friend's computer which rendered its monitor unusable. After extracing all working electronics from their melted housing, they were affixed into a particularly deep picture frame. A new power button needed to be modeled and printed along with additional parts to more effectively direct airflow. This process developed skills in thermal design, 3D modeling, 3D printing, and fabrication.

                On the outside this case may look like the Compaq home computer of yester-year, but it is capable of housing off the shelf parts of today. Additional airflow in the form of a 120mm fan and an 80mm fan were added in order to accomodate more power hunger modern components. USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports were also added along with color-appropriate hot swapable 3.5'' drive bays. All of these upgrades developed skills in measurement, 3D modeling, 3D printing, and fabrication.
