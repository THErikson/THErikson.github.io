						<p>TARDIS stands for tri-axial apparatus for the rotation of dependent and independent samples. I built the first of the TARDIS devices in 2020 to explore how a certain nano-structured material would react to light incident at a variety of angles.</p>					
						<p>Between 2021 and 2022 the device collected hundreds of gigabytes of useful data leading to publications from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360318918_Development_of_the_Triaxial_Apparatus_for_the_Rotation_of_Discrete_and_Independent_Samples">myself</a> and <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/3502/">others</a>. That being said, the apparatus did not work very well. The stepper motors I chose to move the very heavy phone did not have the necessary precision to access the full array of angles. Material and manufacturing choices also lead to difficulties with operation and maintenance. </p>
						<p>The story of TARDIS I is one of productive blunders. It was my first attempt at engineering and helped me get a whole lot of mistakes out of the way at a time when stakes were low.</p>

						<p>TARDIS II was born of the successes and failures of TARDIS I. My updates to the apparatus simplified the design down to a twin-axis apparatus for the rotation of dependent and independent samples.</p>
						<p>Operating TARDIS I for two years showed me where the apparatus could use improvement. TARDIS II is almost entirely modular, easing maintenance and allowing it to adapt to changes in the scope of research as needed. A light webcam operated by a Raspberry Pi saves each image, along with all of its metadata, to a folder on an external hard drive. </p>

						<p>This first-of-its-kind simulator uses four actuators and five projectors to create a 360 degree immersive environment in which to simulate a research ready ride in an autonomous vehicle. This simulator’s construction is a continuation of work which won a <a href="https://umaine.edu/vemi/2022/07/28/vemi-wins-3rd-in-the-inclusive-design-challenge/">US Department of Transportation Award for Inclusive Design</a></p>
						<p>My fingerprints can be found throughout this project. I built the computer that runs the projectors, aligned those projectors and printed brackets to keep them aligned, soldered and installed the cabin lights, installed a cooling system, and managed many feet of cables.</p>

						<p>This is the room where I ran experiments using the first TARDIS device. In those days it had cement walls, a single outlet, and a carpet that doubled as a canopy for a thriving cockroach population. </p>
						<p>Between then and now I helped frame new walls, added additional wiring behind these walls, and installed three network accessible monitors to complete the feeling of a space station. The space room as it is now known houses eighteen plants, each lit by a grow light and fed fertilized water. Water samples taken from these plants are tested using the same nano-structure material as studied by the TARDIS devices. </p>

						<p>The VEMI Lab Makerspace is housed in the basement of UMaine’s Carnegie Hall. Moisture control in that basement is not optimal and can shorten the lifespan of 3D printing filament stored in the area. I created this dehumidifier to reduce that risk. </p>
						<p>The core of the device is a Peltier chip, which gets very hot on one side and very cold on the other. The hot side is cooled by a computer heatsink and fan, while the cold side is affixed to an older computer heatsink which relied on passive cooling. The large spacing of these fins for natural convection means that they are well suited to collect moisture from the air.</p>
