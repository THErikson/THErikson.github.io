						<p>TARDIS stands for tri-axial apparatus for the rotation of dependent and independent samples. The first of the TARDIS devices was built in 2020 to explore how a certain nano-structured material would react to light incident at a variety of angles. </p>
					</div>
					<div id="content" class="4u">						
						<p>The apparatus did not work very well. The stepper motors I chose to move the very heavy phone did not have the necessary precision to access the full array of angles, but between 2021 and 2022 the device was able to collect hundreds of gigabytes of useful data. Despite its limitations TARDIS I and its data produced publications from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360318918_Development_of_the_Triaxial_Apparatus_for_the_Rotation_of_Discrete_and_Independent_Samples">myself</a> and <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/3502/">others</a>.</p>
						<p>The story of TARDIS I is one of productive blunders. It was my first attempt at engineering and helped me get a whole lot of mistakes out of the way at a time when stakes were low.</p>

						<p>TARDIS II was born of the successes and failures of TARDIS I. It was a simpler design which brought the device down to a two-axis apparatus for the rotation of dependent and independent samples. </p>
					</div>
					<div id="content" class="4u">
						<p>Operating TARDIS I for two years showed me where the apparatus could use improvement. Instead of a phone, I chose a much lighter webcam. A raspberry pi controlled this webcam and saved each image, along with all of its metadata, to a folder on an external hard drive. TARDIS II was nearly entirely modular, easing maintenance allowing it to adapt to changes in the scope of research as needed.</p>
						<p>After all of these improvements, I failed to focus the webcam before the focus of research had moved beyond vast arrays of light angles and towards other applications of the material.</p>

						<p>This first of its kind simulator uses four actuators to access three degrees of freedom. Five projectors driven by one computer are used to create a 360 degree immersive environment. This simulator’s construction is a continuation of work which won a US Department of Transportation <a href="https://umaine.edu/vemi/2022/07/28/vemi-wins-3rd-in-the-inclusive-design-challenge/">award</a>.</p>
						<p>I have been involved at every stage of this project where my skills applied. I built the computer that runs the projectors, aligned those projectors and printed brackets to keep them aligned, soldered and installed the cabin lights, installed a cooling system, and managed many feet of cables.</p>

						<p>This room houses eighteen plants, each lit by a grow light and fed fertilized water. Water samples taken from these plants are tested using the same nano-structure material as studied by the TARDIS devices. I did the wiring for this room as well as some of the timber framing for the walls. I also performed much of the finishing work, earning the right to put star trek consoles on the monitors.</p>

						<p>The VEMI Lab Makerspace is housed in the basement of UMaine’s Carnegie Hall. Moisture control in that basement is not optimal and can shorten the lifespan of 3D printing filament stored in the area. This dehumidifier aims to reduce that possibility.</p>
						<p>The core of the device is a Peltier chip. This chip gets very hot on one side and very cold on the other. The hot side is cooled by a computer heatsink and fan, while the cold side is affixed to an older computer heatsink which relied on passive cooling. The large spacing of these fins intended to allow for natural convection means that they are well suited to remove moisture from the air. </p>
