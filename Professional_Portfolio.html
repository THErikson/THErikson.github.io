                TARDIS 1 was used between 2020 and 2022 to collect data pertaining to the behavior of a nano-structured material. Over 350GB of data has been collected using this apparatus thus far. This data and the apparatus itself have contributed to multiple publications.

                TARDIS 2 is designed to perform the same functions as TARDIS 1 with greater efficiency and ease of use. During design a major focus was placed on modularity in order to better adapt to a variety of research needs. TARDIS 2 has been used to collect preliminary data, but has not yet been fully deployed.

    <p class="fs-secondary">
        This first of its kind simulator uses four actuators to access three degrees of freedom. Five projectors driven by one computer are used to create a 360 degree immersive environment. The construction of this level 5 autonomous vehicle simulator is a continuation of work based on a US DOT award for inclusive design.
