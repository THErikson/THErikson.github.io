						<p>This is the computer I used just about every day for half a decade. It is a Crosley record player with fans swapped in for the original speakers and a standard micro-ATX computer in place of its innards. Apart from the recently upgraded fans every part of this case is salvaged at no cost. This was my first project and sparked the entire hobby.</p>
						<p>Every part of this object has a story and they don’t all come through in a picture. For example, the power button came from my college physics building where I found a hoard of electronic waste. Thanks to a Raspberry Pi Pico behind the front panel the left and right knobs function as both knobs and buttons. That record on top of the case is much older than the case itself and smells great. This smell comes from the shellac resin used in its creation which also happens to make it durable enough to not shatter when introduced to a hole saw. </p>

						<p>I find that objects with a story, especially one I had a hand in, spark a special kind of joy. This kit used to play the classic early 2000s rhythm game “Guitar Hero” has sparked plenty of joy in both its creation and use. </p>
						<p>The shell of the computer is a well preserved combination VHS/DVD player. Affixed to this shell are the innards of a gaming laptop. With a bit of added cooling, a couple wifi antennas, and hard drive, this machine is capable of emulating just about any game you might want including the great Guitar Hero.</p>
						<p>A Raspberry Pi Pico, some salvaged electronics, and a bit of 3D printing mingle to make the pedal used to activate Guitar Hero’s star power. The toughest bit of this design was creating a pedal that really makes its user feel like a rock star. Having never been a rock star, this required extensive user acceptance testing. </p>

					<div id="content" class="4u">
						<p>I fell backwards into this hobby, but I have enjoyed the fall. On an afternoon walk I impulsively turned into a jewelry shop to get a diagnosis for my great grandmother's misbehaving wrist watch. I began working with the horologist who had made that diagnosis and learned a whole lot. </p>
						<p>He introduced me to the concept of quartz conversions; removing a non-function movement from an old watch and installing a modern quartz movement. The watch community usually uses putties or adhesives to accomplish this, but I have myself a 3D printer. </p>
						<p>The specific watch shown here was a gift from my father of unknown origin. The original dial was heavily damaged and displayed seconds on a separate dial below the center post. I removed and framed the original assembly and printed a new one, including a chapter ring and crown. While I have executed a number of other conversions, this continues to inject the most joy into checking the time.</p>

						<p>My father is an avid collector of both picture frames and photos of hairy musicians to put in those frames. When a friend passed along a laptop whose screen had melted due to a MATLAB related fire, I saw an opportunity to combine the household hobbies.</p>
						<p>Custom mounts for both the power button and charging port were printed to keep the computer functional. Cutouts were added and painted for all the ports as well as a larger opening for the fan exhaust. The computer works the way a computer should and looks right at home in its frame. Functional art makes a fine addition to the world no matter how you approach it and this is nothing if not functional art. </p>

						<p>My cat’s name is Parsnip and she is the best. As she has my whole entire heart, I have done my best to supply her with all the toys her heart desires. This project was a step in that direction and it was not the last.</p>
						<p>The toy is a laser pointer which rotates on two separate axes, each controlled by a servo motor. Every second, one of these motors rotates to a random angle within a certain range. The chosen range allows the toy to project a cone of entertainment on any surface with the press of a button. </p>
						<p>The toy has been retired as it overstimulates parsnip, leaving her looking dejected and panicked after the laser disappears. I hope to resurrect the toy as part of an automatic feeder to allow Parsnip to live the life of a predator once again.  </p>

					<div id="content" class="4u">
						<p>The first boot of a machine is a sort of ritual to me. It has a rhythm to it that makes a USB stick I bought for my elementary school book reports seem out of place. That is part of the reason I created this set of boot drives. I also wanted a use for some 16 GB SATA drives and an excuse to try out a 3D technique. </p>
						<p>The cases of these drives were custom modeled and printed. First the black portion of each case was printed and then the alternate color logos were printed on top using a different filament. The reader, also housed in a custom case, allows each drive to be accessed via USB. </p>
						<p>The resulting set of drives are worthy of my ritual. They are just as functional as any USB stick and much more exciting to handle. The goal of this one was really just to make square one sparkle.</p>

						<p>In its previous life this case housed compact disc drives and nothing else. While it had an unused pair of USB 2.0 ports and a full array of buttons, it did not have the hardware to mount a motherboard. This made it a perfect candidate from the sleeper PC treatment, which entails modifying an older looking computer case to accommodate high power modern components. </p>
						<p>I replaced the USB 2.0 ports with USB 3.0, swapped the disc drives with fans, and glued in some 3D printed mounting points for a standard motherboard. I even added an age-appropriate mount for a 3.5” hard drive. The next computer to live in this case will enjoy exceptional airflow and all the comforts of the 21st century. </p>

						<p>My projects tend to lean heavily toward the utility end of the Vitruvius triad. By leveraging the cuteness of my furry friends, I hope to explore a more beauty-focused side of creation. </p>
						<p>These hand-held lithophanes are printed using four filaments allowing me to access the entire CMYK color gamut. A diffusion sheet and fresnel lens, borrowed from a laptop screen, diffuse the harsh light emitted by an LED. The flip of a switch can fill the reflective chamber with enough light to bring a starling degree of life to any image. </p>
						<p>By designing these to be extremely simple to both print and assemble, I believe I have unlocked a truly excellent gift for just about any occasion. </p>
