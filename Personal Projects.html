						<p>This is the computer I used just about every day for half a decade. It is a Crosley record player with fans swapped in for the original speakers and a standard micro-ATX computer in place of its innards. Apart from the recently upgraded fans every part of this case is salvaged at no cost. This was my first project and sparked the entire hobby.</p>
						<p>Every part of this object has a story and they don’t all come through in a picture. For example, the power button came from my college physics building where I found a hoard of electronic waste. Thanks to a Raspberry Pi Pico behind the front panel the left and right knobs function as both knobs and buttons. That record on top of the case is much older than the case itself and smells great. This smell comes from the shellac resin used in its creation which also happens to make it durable enough to not shatter when introduced to a hole saw. </p>

						<p>I do not like turning away electronics in need of a home. The dream is to have a use in mind for any type of waste that might come my way. This project provided a home for two particularly forlorn pieces of electronic waste. </p>
						<p>The shell of the computer is a well preserved combination VHS/DVD player. Affixed to this shell are the innards of a gaming laptop. With a bit of added cooling, a couple wifi antennas, and hard drive, this machine is capable of emulating just about any game you might want. I added a few front USB ports and a power LED to make the computer suitable for life under a TV stand. </p>

						<p>My father is an avid collector of both picture frames and photos of hairy musicians to put in those frames. When a friend passed along a laptop whose screen had melted due to a MATLAB related fire, I saw an opportunity to combine the household hobbies.</p>
						<p>Custom mounts for both the power button and charging port were printed to keep the computer functional. Cutouts were added and painted for all the ports as well as a larger opening for the fan exhaust. The computer works the way a computer should and looks right at home in its frame. Functional art makes a fine addition to the world no matter how you approach it and this is nothing if not functional art. </p>

						<p>My cat’s name is Parsnip and she is the best. As she has my whole entire heart, I have done my best to supply her with all the toys her heart desires. This project is a step in that direction and it will not be the last.</p>
						<p>The toy is a laser pointer which rotates on two separate axes, each controlled by a servo motor. Every second, one of these motors rotates to a random angle within a certain range. The chosen range allows the toy to project a cone of entertainment on any surface with the press of a button. </p>
						<p>The toy has been retired as it overstimulates parsnip and leaves her looking dejected and panicked when the laser disappears. I hope to resurrect the toy as the trigger to an automatic feeder to allow Parsnip to live the life of a predator once again. </p>

					<div id="content" class="4u">
						<p>The first boot of a machine is a sort of ritual to me. It has a rhythm to it that makes a USB stick I bought for my elementary school book reports seem out of place. That is part of the reason I created this set of boot drives. I also wanted a use for some 16 GB SATA drives and an excuse to try out a 3D technique. </p>
						<p>The cases of these drives were custom modeled and printed. First the black portion of each case was printed and then the alternate color logos were printed on top using a different filament. The reader, also housed in a custom case, allows each drive to be accessed via USB. </p>
						<p>The resulting set of drives are worthy of my ritual. They are just as functional as any USB stick and much more exciting to handle. The goal of this one was really just to make square one sparkle.</p>

						<p>In its previous life this case housed compact disc drives and nothing else. While it had an unused pair of USB 2.0 ports and a full array of buttons, it did not have the hardware to mount a motherboard. This made it a perfect candidate from the sleeper PC treatment, which entails modifying an older looking computer case to accommodate high power modern components. </p>
						<p>I replaced the USB 2.0 ports with USB 3.0, swapped the disc drives with fans, and glued in some 3D printed mounting points for a standard motherboard. I even added an age-appropriate mount for a 3.5” hard drive. The next computer to live in this case will enjoy exceptional airflow and all the comforts of the 21st century. </p>
